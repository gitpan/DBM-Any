====================
DBM::Any version 0.1
====================

DBM::Any puts an object-oriented interface on AnyDBM_File.  The
BerkeleyDB modules support an OO interface, which I like, and it
makes them easier to pass around; why shouldn't the other formats
support it?

The usual installation instructions apply:

    /path/to/perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

DBM::Any requires these other modules and libraries:

    AnyDBM_File

You will also need at least one DBM-type module installed.
Fortunately, Perl tends to come with one. :-)
